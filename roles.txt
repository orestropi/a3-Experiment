There are 5 tasks (not counting Get Participants) but 4 people, so someone will have to double up.
All Coding tasks except Visualize Results need to be done before we can run the experiment.
Please inform the rest of the team which task(s) you are working on.

Pre collection:
	Visualization Generator
		(probably mostly in d3)
		- At least 3 types of visualizations
		- Random datapoints, select two for comparison
		- Simple style

	Interactive (the part the participants see)
		(probably mostly in HTML / JavaScript)
		- similar to the video, but UI can be different
		- show visualizations in a random order, call Visualization Generator code to generate them
		- call Response Storage code

	Response Storage
		(probably mostly in JavaScript)
		- respondent's percent, actual percent, some metadata about the graphs

Get Participants - Everyone

Post collection:
	Data visualization
		(could be in d3, R, or something else)
		- error scaling
		- rank charts
		- confidence intervals

	Writeup
